His paintings evoke bucolic scenes: the peaceful meanders of the river, the golden reflections of sunsets on the water, and the lush hills surrounding the village. Bernard perfectly masters the art of playing with light, inspired by the Impressionists who once walked the same lands. His paintings reflect a gentle, almost nostalgic atmosphere, as if he seeked to freeze moments of eternity on the canvas. His retirement allows him to enjoy each brushstroke without the pressure of deadlines. For Bernard, every painting sold is an opportunity to share a fragment of his intimate vision of Bennecourt, a little piece of paradise he has cherished forever."
